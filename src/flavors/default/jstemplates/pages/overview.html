<p>Please indicate locations where you have observed unsafe behavior and conditions that threaten the safety of pedestrians, people on bikes and people in motor vehicles.  Together with the NYPD and our elected officials, we will work to remedy them.</p>

<p>We also recommend attending the 78th Precinct Community Council meeting the last Tuesday of each month (except December, July and August).</p>
